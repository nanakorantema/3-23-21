# Causal vs. Predictive Models

income ~ liberalism

- Predictive models care nothing about causation
- Every model is predictive, in the sense that, if we give you new data — and it is drawn from a stable distribution — then you can create a predictive forecast
- so it has some quality that cannot be changed/ is independent of new factor--> for example age
ex. if you change your political ideology your pay won't change

Causal->
- existing correlative relationship?
- "no causation without manipulation" - you need some type of treatment that can manipulate the situation
- potential outcomes- change in income

potential outcomes of what?
  - income as outcome variable-> income over 100k and below 100k
